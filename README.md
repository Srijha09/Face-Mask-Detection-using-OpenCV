# Face Mask Detection using Deep Learning and OpenCV
The Covid-19 virus changed our lives and has changed our habits and also because of it many of us entered social isolation. There are cities and places like marts, supermarkets, etc that it is an obligation to use a mask when you are on the streets or inside them.
The objective of this project is to train a deep convolutional neural network on images collected from the internet to check if a person is using a mask or not.
